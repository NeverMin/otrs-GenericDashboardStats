=head1 NAME

GenericDashboardStats

=head1 DESCRIPTION

As of today (Aug 2012) the 7 day statistic widget for the dashboard knows only two stats: closed tickets and created tickets.

This is not enough and to add new stats to that widget or change the current ones you need programming skills.

C<GenericDashboardStats> allows to add/change stats easily with new configuration files for the SysConfig. So you can show the stats you want.

=head1 CREATE NEW STATS

To create new stats you have to add only your own configuration file. The subsequent sections show different types of stats.

=head2 The "standard" closed ticket graph

Create a file C<$OTRS_HOME/Kernel/Config/Files/AnyName.xml> where "AnyName" can be whatever you want. Though I recommend to name it the same way you want to name the graph.

The XML file has this content:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <otrs_config version="1.0" init="Application">
    <CVS>$Id: Ticket.xml,v 1.500 2012/02/14 08:59:22 mg Exp $</CVS>
    <ConfigItem Name="GenericDashboardStats::Stats###030-Closed" Required="0" Valid="1">
        <Description Translatable="1">How many tickets were created the day</Description>
        <Group>GenericDashboardStats</Group>
        <SubGroup>Stats</SubGroup>
        <Setting>
            <Hash>
                <Item Key="OptionKey">ClosedStats</Item>
                <Item Key="type">TicketClose</Item>
                <Item Key="color">#eeff00</Item>
                <Item Key="label">Closed</Item>
            </Hash>
        </Setting>
    </ConfigItem>
  </otrs_config>

That's it! Nothing more.

Now, what does the settings mean?

=over 4

=item * OptionKey

The OptionKey is just a unique key for this graph. This is used to define the name of an other SysConfig option that defines more search parameters (see second example below).

=item * type

Define what time-parameter is used for the ticket search. You can use the following values:

=over 4

=item * TicketCreate

Tickets created on the given day.

=item * TicketClose

Tickets closed on the given day.

=item * TicketChange

Tickets changed on the given day.

=item * TicketPending

=item * TicketEscalation

=item * TicketEscalationUpdate

=item * TicketEscalationResponse

=item * TicketEscalationSolution

=item * ArticleCreate

articles with create time after ... (article newer than this date).

=back

=item * color

Color of the graph.

=item * label

Mouse over label for the graph.

An other example: Show graph of ticket that were created in queue "Junk"

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <otrs_config version="1.0" init="Application">
      <ConfigItem Name="GenericDashboardStats::Stats###001-Created-Junk" Required="0" Valid="1">
          <Description Translatable="1">How many tickets were created the day in the queue Junk</Description>
          <Group>GenericDashboardStats</Group>
          <SubGroup>Stats</SubGroup>
          <Setting>
              <Hash>
                  <Item Key="OptionKey">CreatedJunkStats</Item>
                  <Item Key="type">TicketCreate</Item>
                  <Item Key="color">#eeff00</Item>
                  <Item Key="label">Created In Junk</Item>
              </Hash>
          </Setting>
      </ConfigItem>
      <ConfigItem Name="CreatedJunkStats###Queues" Required="0" Valid="1">
          <Description Translatable="1">Define the Queues the CreatedJunkStats stat is for</Description>
          <Group>GenericDashboardStats</Group>
          <SubGroup>CreatedJunkStats</SubGroup>
          <Setting>
              <Array>
                  <Item>Junk</Item>
              </Array>
          </Setting>
      </ConfigItem>
  </otrs_config>

The first I<ConfigItem> part is described above. The second one adds more search paramters. The name of the item is created by the value of I<OptionKey> in the first config option then "###" and the last part of the name is the search option. At L<http://otrs.perl-services.de/docs/otrs/rel-3_3/kernel_system_ticketsearch.html> you can see all the options for the ticket search.
